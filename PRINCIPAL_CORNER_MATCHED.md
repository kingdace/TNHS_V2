# ✅ Principal Corner Admin - Matched with Frontend!

## 🎯 What I Did:

### Removed 3 Unused Content Types from Admin:

    - Principal biography, journey, and career history
    - Icon: User
    - Color: Teal

2. ✅ **Principal's Vision** (`vision`)

    - Vision statements and strategic goals
    - Icon: Target
    - Color: Purple

3. ✅ **Achievement & Award** (`achievement`)
    - Awards, recognitions, and achievements
