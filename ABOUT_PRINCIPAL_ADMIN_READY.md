## 🎯 What Content to Add:

Based on the image showing the "About the Principal" section, add this content to the **"Full Leadership Profile"** field:

```
A seasoned leader and true academic at heart, Dr. Manuel B. Dayondon now serves as the School Principal IV of Taft National High School—bringing with him decades of experience, wisdom, and a deep understanding of the school he once called home.

Before assuming the principalship, he served as Assistant Principal of Taft NHS, and previously led several schools with excellence: San Jose National High School, Cabrera-Altres National High School, Anomar National High School, and Mat-i National High School.

A former teacher of both Taft NHS and Surigao City National High School, he remains rooted in the classroom as a graduate school instructor at St. Paul University Surigao.

Dr. Dayondon is not just an administrator—he is a mentor, scholar, and steady hand guiding the entire Taft NHS community forward.
