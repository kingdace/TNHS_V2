# Event Calendar Integration Analysis & Improvement Plan

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Working

1. **Database Structure**: Complete Event model with proper schema
2. **Admin Interface**: Functional Events.jsx page for CRUD operations
3. **API Endpoints**: Both admin and public API controllers implemented
4. **Home Page Integration**: Calendar widget displaying events from database
5. **Service Layer**: Both adminService and publicService have event methods

### ❌ Current Issues & Gaps

#### 1. **Calendar Display Issues**

-   Home page shows "Exam Calendar" but should be "Event Calendar"
-   Calendar styling could be more polished and user-friendly
-   Event indicators on calendar dates are basic (just red dots)
-   Modal popup for event details needs better formatting

#### 2. **Admin-to-Public Flow Problems**

-   Events created in admin don't immediately reflect visual changes on home page
-   No real-time updates or cache invalidation
-   Limited event type visual differentiation on public calendar

#### 3. **User Experience Issues**

-   Calendar navigation is basic (prev/next month only)
-   No event filtering on public side
-   No event search functionality on public calendar
-   Limited event details in modal popup
-   No event images displayed on public calendar

#### 4. **Missing Features**

-   No event categories/tags beyond basic types
-   No recurring events support
-   No event registration/RSVP functionality
-   No event notifications or reminders
-   No calendar export functionality (iCal, Google Calendar)

#### 5. **Visual & Design Issues**

-   Calendar design doesn't match overall site theme consistently
-   Event type colors not standardized
-   Mobile responsiveness could be improved
-   Loading states need enhancement
