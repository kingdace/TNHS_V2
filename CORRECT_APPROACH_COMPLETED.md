# ✅ Correct Approach - Completed!

## 🎯 What I Fixed:

You're RIGHT - you already have **Principal Corner** in the admin panel. I made it confusing by creating a SEPARATE page.

### ❌ What I Did Wrong:

-   Created a separate "Principal Profile" admin page
-   Made things confusing

### ✅ What I Did Right:

-   **DELETED** the separate Principal Profile page
-   **ADDED** a new content type called **"About the Principal"** to the existing **Principal Corner**

## 🎯 How to Add the Biography Content:

    - **Content:** Paste the full biography from your image:

        ```
        A seasoned leader and true academic at heart, Dr. Manuel B. Dayondon now serves as the School Principal IV of Taft National High School—bringing with him decades of experience, wisdom, and a deep understanding of the school he once called home.

        Before assuming the principalship, he served as Assistant Principal of Taft NHS, and previously led several schools with excellence: San Jose National High School, Cabrera-Altres National High School, Anomar National High School, and Mat-i National High School.

        A former teacher of both Taft NHS and Surigao City National High School, he remains rooted in the classroom as a graduate school instructor at St. Paul University Surigao.

        Dr. Dayondon is not just an administrator—he is a mentor, scholar, and steady hand guiding the entire Taft NHS community forward.
